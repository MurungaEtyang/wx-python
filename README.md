# According to code you provide 
# code generate data and save into json

#  so I have created a GUI application using wxPython library.

# once you open the application it checks if 'data.json' exist.
# if data.json exist it will display data.

# if there are no data then click **Generate Users:** Clicking the "Generate Users" button triggers the generation of simulated campaign data.
# **Display Data:** The generated campaign data is displayed in a list, showing campaign names, budgets, spending, clicks, impressions, and associated users.
# **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific users, and the displayed data will be filtered accordingly.


# how to run the code
- "before running the application make sure you have installed the necessary python libraries"
- pip install wxPython
- pip install faker
- python or py frontend.py
- py frontend.py

# incase of any issue conctact me
